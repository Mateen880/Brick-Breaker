# Brick-Breaker
ðŸ§± Brick Breaker Game â€“ C++ with OpenGL
A classic Brick Breaker arcade game recreated using C++ and OpenGL. This game features paddle control, ball physics, and multiple bricks to break with a clean visual interface.

âœ¨ Features
ðŸŽ® Interactive paddle movement with smooth ball control

ðŸ§± Multiple breakable bricks displayed in a structured grid

ðŸ”„ Ball bounce logic with wall, paddle, and brick collision handling

ðŸŽ¨ Visuals rendered using OpenGL primitives

ðŸ’¥ Bricks disappear upon collision, simulating real-time effects

ðŸ§  Basic game mechanics ideal for learning game loops and graphics in C++

This project is great for students exploring graphics programming, OpenGL, and fundamental game development in C++.
